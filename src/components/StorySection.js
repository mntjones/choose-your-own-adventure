The power was overwhelming. \n Sam stopped fighting as Dean – Dean’s body – turned to face him. He didn’t recognize the face staring back at him."},

		{choice: DBA, text: "I’m sorry, Sammy. I failed you. I can’t fail the world. \n It’s ok, Dean. Don’t watch. I’ll be with Mom and Dad. \n Sam took the angel blade from Dean and handed it to Cass. Then he removed the Colt from his waistband. Dean turned around and watched the dark clouds swirl around them faster and faster. The loud crack went off and the world went black. \n --5 years later – \n The last of humanity was huddled in a cave as the flashes of light seemed to come closer. The war between the angels and the humans was near the end. How naïve humanity was to think that they stood a chance. Dean touched the amulet around his neck in remembrance, before hefting the spear that was enhanced by the witch Rowena to kill an angel with a touch. One last fight before he’d see his family again."},
