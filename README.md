This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description

This Choose Your Own Adventure app is based on the collection of books from the 1980-90s where a reader begins with an opening scene, and then makes a decision for the character that takes them to the next section of the story based on that decision. 

You can read the book several times, make different decisions, which will give you a different story.
